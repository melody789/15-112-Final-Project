Tibetan cuisine includes the culinary traditions and practices
 of Tibet and its peoples, many of whom reside in India and 
Nepal. The cuisine reflects the Tibetan landscape of mountains
and plateaus and includes influences from neighbours. It is 
known for its use of noodles, goat, yak, mutton, dumplings, 
cheese (often from yak or goat milk), butter (also from 
animals adapted to the Tibetan climate) and soups.
