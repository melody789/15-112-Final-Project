Yunnan cuisine is known for its sour and spicy dishes. Tough 
commonly seasoned with chilies, Yunnan Cuisine, unlike the 
mouth-stinging fiery food in neighboring Sichuan, strives to
keep the original taste of its ingredients, which are 
freshly plucked from mountains and caught from the sea.
The most extraordinary feature of Yunnan food is its vastly 
varied ingredients, including vegetables, tropical fruits, 
flowers and even insects.
