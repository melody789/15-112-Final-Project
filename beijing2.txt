Beijing roast duck or Peking Duck is the epitome of Beijing
cuisine and if you had to choose just one dish to try whilst 
in the capital, this would be it. The dish is mostly esteemed 
for the thin, crispy skin, with authentic versions of the 
dish serving mostly skin and little meat. Whilst sauces and 
accompaniments will vary between restaurants (the most common 
being scallion and cucumber) it is difficult to go wrong with 
roast duck in Beijing.
