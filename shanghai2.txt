Shanghai boasts one of China's best and most distinctive
cuisines. Influenced by its position just south of the 
Yangtze River and at the mouth of the Huangpu River, the
region abounds in a selection of freshwater fish and 
shellfish. Dishes from this area are delicately seasoned.
Shanghai's people have a 'sweet tooth', and more sugar is
 used in Shanghai than in any other part of China.
