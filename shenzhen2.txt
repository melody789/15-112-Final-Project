A wide variety of foodstuffs are used to make Cantonese 
dishes. Therefore, it surprises foreigners sometimes. 
The saying "They eat everything with four legs except 
tables and everything that flies except airplanes" is 
an exaggeration. But dishes might contain snakes, cats, 
dogs and sea life not familiar to most foreigners. Keep 
that in mind when you are ordering something off the 
menu with strange Cantonese names.
