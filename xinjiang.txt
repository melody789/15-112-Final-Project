Xinjiang is located in the central part of the Eurasian Continent,
on the northwest border of China. It covers about one-sixth of
the country's total territory, 1,664,900 square kilometers (about 
642,821 square miles), making it the largest administrative
division with also the longest land frontier and most neighboring
 countries in the country. However, only about 4.3% of its 
territory is habitable. The rest is mostly desert such as Gobi,
 snow-capped mountains and glaciers.
