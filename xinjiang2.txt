Xinjiang cuisine reflects the cooking styles of many ethnic 
groups of the Xinjiang region, and refers particularly to 
Uyghur cuisine. Signature ingredients include roasted mutton, 
kebabs, roasted fish, and rice. Because of the Muslim population,
the food is predominantly halal.
Kazakhs eat with their hands. Ceremonial foods for certain groups 
include horse milk (kymyz) for the Kyrgyz and sheep entrails for
the Xibe.
