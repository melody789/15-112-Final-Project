Tibet (Classical Tibetan: Bod; (????), Lhasa dialect: P?; Mandarin 
Chinese: Î÷²Ø, X¨©z¨¤ng) is an autonomous region of China.
Entering Tibet you feel as though you've entered an entirely 
different world. The traditional Tibetan culture remains 
strong and central to the region despite economic development
and migration of other Chinese ethnic groups to Lhasa.
