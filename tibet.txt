Tibet (Classical Tibetan: Bod) is an autonomous region
of China.Entering Tibet you feel as though you've entered 
an entirely different world. The traditional Tibetan 
culture remains strong and central to the region despite 
economic development and migration of other Chinese ethnic
groups to Lhasa.
